Logo:
Logo was created using canvas.com in PNG format and converted to SVG format. I chose SVG format to be able to scale the logo, control color fill and background color. The logo can also be used as an icon. The filter was adapte from Barrett Sonntag's "CSS filter generator to convert from black to target hex color" Codepen Notebook. 


Hex codes
#0f96b3 – turquoise 
#156cba– blue
#0db141- green
#015264– font colour
#ffa600 – for links upon hover
